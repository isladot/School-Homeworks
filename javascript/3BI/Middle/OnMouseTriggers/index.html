            These were the early days; you could fit everything there was to
            know about HTML into the back of your car. Pages weren’t pretty, but
            at least they were hypertext enabled. No one cared much about
            presentation, and just about everyone on the Web had their very own
            “home page.” Even a count of the number of pencils, paperclips, and
            Post-it notes on your desk was considered “web content” back then
            (you think we’re kidding).

            The long, cold days of the “Browser Wars.” Netscape and Microsoft
            were duking it out for control of the world. After all, he who
            controls the browser controls the universe, right? At the center of
            the fallout was the web developer. During the wars, an arms race
            emerged as each browser company kept adding their own proprietary
            extensions in order to stay ahead. Who could keep up? And not only
            that, back in those days, you had to often write two separate web
            pages: one for the Netscape browser and one for Internet Explorer.
            Not good.

            Ahhh…the end of the Browser Wars and, to our rescue, the World Wide
            Web Consortium (nickname: W3C). Their plan: to bring order to the
            universe by creating the ONE HTML “standard” to rule them all. The
            key to their plan? Separate HTML’s structure and presentation into
            two languages—a language for structure (HTML) and a language for
            presentation (CSS)—and convince the browser makers it was in their
            best interest to adopt these standards. But did their plan work? Uh,
            almost…with a few changes (see HTML 4.01).

          <h3>HTML 4.01</h3>
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/gXX0voX.jpg"
            alt="HTML 4.01"

          <p id="t4">
            The good life: HTML 4.01 entered the scene in 1999, and was the
            “must have” version of HTML for the next decade. 4.01 wasn’t really
            a big change from 4.0; just a few fixes were needed here and there.
            But compared to the early days of HTML (when we all had to walk
            barefoot in six feet of snow, uphill both ways), HTML 4.01 allowed
            us all to sleep well at night knowing that almost all browsers
            (atleast the ones anyone would care about) were going to display our
            content just fine.

          <h3>XHTML 1.0</h3>
          <img

            Just as we were all getting comfortable, a shiny object distracted
            everyone. That shiny object was XML. In fact, it really distracted
            HTML, and the two got hitched in a shotgun marriage that resulted in
            XHTML 1.0. XHTML promised to end all the woes of the Web with its
            adherence to strictness and new way of doing things. The only
            problem was, people ended up hating XHTML. They didn’t want a new
            way to write web pages, they just wanted to improve what they
            already had with HTML 4.01. Web developers were far more interested
            in HTML’s flexibility than XHTML’s strictness

          />
          <p id="t6">
            Of course, with no support from the community, the marriage didn’t
            end well and was replaced by new version of HTML named HTML5. With
            its support for most of the HTML 4.01 standard, and new features
            that reflect the way the Web has grown, HTML5 is what developers
            were looking for. And, with features like support for blog-like
            elements, new video and graphic capabilities, and a whole new set of
            capabilties aimed at building web applications, HTML5 was destined
            to become the standard.
